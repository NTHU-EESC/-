11195 - Hanoi   

Description
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game puzzle. It consists of three rods, which are A, B and C. The puzzle starts with n disks in ascending order of size on rod A, the smallest at the top.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

1.   Only one disk can be moved at a time.

2.   Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.

3.   No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Write a program to simulate the moves of the disks. Print the number of disk which is moved in each step.

 

For example, if n = 3, the moves of each steps are:

move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
move disk 2 from rod A to rod B
move disk 1 from rod C to rod B
move disk 3 from rod A to rod C
move disk 1 from rod B to rod A
move disk 2 from rod B to rod C
move disk 1 from rod A to rod C

HINT : You can modify this sample code and implement the function 'hanoi'

#include <stdio.h>
void hanoi(int n, char A, char B, char C);

int main(){
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    hanoi(n, 'A', 'B', 'C');
    return 0;
}

Input
An integer n (0<n<20), which means the number of disk.

Output
Print out the number of disk which is moved in each step, and there is a '\n' at the end of each line.
