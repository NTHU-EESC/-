Description
In a shell game, balls with different numbers are hidden beneath identical containers, which are placed in a line. After the containers are shuffled, players need to guess the order of balls.

 

In this problem, there are five balls, numbered 0-4, and placed under five identical containers. The containers are placed in a straight line, and the initial positions of balls are from 0-4. The problem will then give k swaps of containers. Each swap is represented by a pair of integers, (a,b), meaning the container is position a is swapped with the container in position b. Your program needs to print the final ordering of balls.

 

For example, k=3, and three swaps are

0 4

2 3

1 2

 

Initially, the order of balls is: 0 1 2 3 4. After the swap (0,4), the order of balls becomes: 4 1 2 3 0; After the swap (2,3), the order of balls becomes: 4 1 3 2 0; and after the swap (1,2), the order of balls becomes:

4 3 1 2 0. So your program needs to print

4 3 1 2 0

Input
The first line of the input is an integer k (0 < k < 25), which specifies the number of swaps. In the next k lines, each line contains a pair of integers, specifying the two positions to be swapped.

Output
The order of balls after swaps. Note that you do not need to print ¡¥\n¡¦ at the end of the output.

Sample Input
3
0 4
2 3
1 2 

Sample Output
4 3 1 2 0
