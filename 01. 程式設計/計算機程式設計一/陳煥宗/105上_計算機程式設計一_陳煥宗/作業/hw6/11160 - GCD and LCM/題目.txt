11160 - GCD and LCM   

Description
Given three positive integers x, y, and z.

Compute their greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM).

Hint : gcd(a,b,c) = gcd(gcd(a,b),c).

Input
The first line contains a positive integer N, which indicates the number of testcases in each input.

In the next N lines, each line contains three positive integer X, Y, Z.

 

Case 1: X, Y, Z < 10

Case 2: X, Y, Z < 10^2

Case 3: X, Y, Z < 10^3

Case 4: X, Y, Z < 10^4

Output
For each testcase, output the GCD and LCM of X, Y, and Z in a line.

Note that you have to add '\n' at the end of output.
