Given a link list structure named Node.

 

typedef struct _Node {

    int data;

    struct _Node *next;

} Node;

 

Given a list, rotate the list to the left by k places, where k is non-negative and k is smaller than the count of nodes in linked list.

For example: 
Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL and k = 3, 
return 4->5->1->2->3->NULL.

 

Input
The input contains 2 sequence of positive integers.The first sequence is to create a linked list of integers, except the last one, which is -1, indicating the end of the sequence. The second line is an integer k. 

Output
The output contains the sequence of resulting linklist.
