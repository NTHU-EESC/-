// Q4 110060007 黃俊穎
// Please write a program to find the smallest positive integer, N, N >= 2,
// such that N^2 cannot be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers.
// For example,
//   2^2 = 4 = 2 + 2
// since 2 is a prime, thus N > 2.
// Also,
//   3^2 = 9 = 2 + 7
// both 2 and 7 are primes, thus N > 3.
// Your program should start searching from N = 2. When the first such N
// that its square cannot be expressed as a sum of two primes is found,
// your program should stop and print out the result.
// Execution example: 
//
// $ ./a.out
// The smallest N that N^2 is not a sum of two primes: xx
//
