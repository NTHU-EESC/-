10310 - Math Loop   

Description
Observe the following instructions to solve a simple problem.

1.Input a sequence A, and then arrange the sequence number from large to small in order to get the new sequence B.

2.Do in the same way by step 1, but this time arrange the sequence A from small to large in order to get another sequence C.

3.Calculate the difference of B and C, that is, B-C.

4.Use B-C in step 3 as a new sequence A and repeat the above steps 1 to 3. 

5.The repetitions end when a difference has been observed in the previous operations.

6.Finally you need to print the times that step 3 is executed.

 

Note: the input won¡¦t be 0.

 

Example: 

For the sequence A=3412, the sequence B from large to small is 4321. Besides, the sequence C from small to large is 1234. 
Then follow the above instructions, we have 4321 - 1234 = 3087, 8730 - 378 = 8352, 8532 - 2358 = 6174, 7641 - 1467 = 6174.
In this case, you should print the number 4.

For another sequence A=12345, the sequence B from large to small is 54321. Besides, the sequence C from small to large is 12345. 
Then follow the above instructions, we have 54321 - 12345 = 41976, 97641 - 14679 = 82962, 98622 - 22689 = 75933, 97533 - 33579 = 63954, 96543 - 34569 = 61974, 97641 - 14769 = 82962.
In this case, you should print the number 6.

 

Input
The input sequence contains no more than six digits.
