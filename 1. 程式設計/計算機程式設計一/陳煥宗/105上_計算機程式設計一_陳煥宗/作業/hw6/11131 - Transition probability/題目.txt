11131 - Transition probability   

Description
Bob is a businessman. He always stays at city A or city  B.

Assume Bob stays at city A today , and we can use a transition matrix P to infer the probability of at which city will Bob stays tomorrow.

e.g.
Let  VnT = [ va , vb ]

Vn is a 2 by 1 column vector.
va denotes the probability that Bob stays at city A on n-th day,
vb denotes the probability that Bob stay at city B on n-th day.
After 1 day, the probability should be represented as Vn+1 , where Vn+1 = P * Vn.

P is a 2 by 2 square matrix, representing the transition probability:

P = ┌ p1  p2 ┐
    └ p3  p4 ┘
As time passes, the probability of Bob staying at city A will decrease.

After n days, the probability of Bob staying at city A will smaller than or equal to a target value T.

The question is :

Suppose that Bob stays at city A today ( va = 1 , vb = 0)
How many days do we need to make va smaller than or equal to the target value T ?
Namely , n = ?

Note :

The test case will make va monotonically decrease .

Input
There are multiple testcases in the input.

The first line contains a integer N, indicating the number of testcases.

You can use this format in your code:

int i , N;

scanf("%d",&N);

for(i=0;i<N;i++){

      // your code to deal with each testcase

}
The following lines are testcases.

For each testcase, there are 5 floating points in a line.

The 1st ~ 4th floating points (p1, p2, p3, p4) are the elements in trasition matrix P.

The 5th floating point is the target value T.

Output
For each testcase.

Output integer n that tell us how many days should we take to reach the target probability.

And add a '\n' at the end of each output.
